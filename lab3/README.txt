In order to build this app, you will need the youtube API and also youtube installed into your emulator/phone. 
Otherwise the playback feature will not work.

Login is built with Google API, you may not be able to login in you do not have the SHA1 : 8F:3C:E6:3B:40:86:B9:6B:FF:23:DE:21:C0:89:8E:B7:7B:D1:4E:21


General Overview:
Our group struggled with this project. We felt as if it were another big project (similar to our swift one) but for android. 
We recall another group literally made this app for their swift project.
On top of that, there was very little documentation on how to use the youtube API. 
We probably spent around 7 hours trying to create a list but were unsuccessful.
Because of this, we we're unable to get a fully functional search list & favorites view.
Currently those tabs have only non-functional mockups.

However, we do have a working login with google API, and video player using the youtube API.

The video player is fully functional on my personal android phone, however does not properly work while in android studio's emulator. 
This issue is due to the emulator not having the youtube app built in.

Team responsibilities!

Alan Wei: search functionality

Danny Nuch: Danny worked on LogIn Page and set up authetication.

Jared Cook: Attempted to help with login functionality and youtube integration. Also tried to create the recycler view layout, but ran out of time.
